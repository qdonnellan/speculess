# speculess

I created speculess during a phase in 2012 when I was super excited about the micro 4/3 camera platform. I was still new to python, but at this point I had figured out a little bit about version control. This was originally a mercurial repo hosted on Kiln; enjoy some of my commit messages for a good laugh.

The app is still live at [speculess.appspot.com](http://speculess.appspot.com)

Here are some screen shots that should give you a sense of what the app did. 

## Lens List
A visual list of all lenses on the platform (at the time this app was created). The color bars represent how many of my users "have it" (green), "want it" (blue), or "don't want it" (red).

## Lens reviews
Users could contribute their personal reviews of the lenses as well as tag it with their major uses.

## User Profiles
I was still playing around with the concept of authentication and user profiles - here we have a "user bag" which is just this guy's public record of the lenses he currently owns or wants to own, and his reviews of those lenses.
