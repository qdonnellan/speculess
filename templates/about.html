			<h4>What is speculess?</h4>
			<p>Speculess is just another way of sorting through the many micro four-thirds lenses out there. There are many great blogs, reviews, technical breakdowns, and lists on the web and we hope speculess serves as your launching point to those resources. </p>
			<p>We think sometimes a user needs a concise, sentence-long, well written "impression" before they are ready to read pages-long reviews of lenses. Speculess enables bloggers and other photogs to write those snippet blurbs about a lens as a quick snapshot. The prospective lens buyer can glance across the short musings and get an immediate feel for the lens.</p>
			<p>Bloggers can use these impressions to drive traffic to their sites and promote their reviews</p>
			<p>"Speculess" comes from the latin "speculum" (meaning "mirror") and well, "less" as a play on "mirrorless" as in the foundation of the micro four-thirds camera system.</p>
